# Light Dark Mode

This is a simple web application that allows users to switch between dark and light modes. The user's chosen theme is stored in local storage, ensuring that their preference is remembered even after closing and reopening the application.

## Features

- Toggle between dark and light modes for improved readability.
- Automatically remembers the selected theme using local storage.

## Getting Started

To experience the Dark and Light Mode Application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bhavani-Singh/Light_Dark_Mode.git

2. **Open the Application:**
Navigate to the project directory and open index.html in a web browser.

3. **Toggle Themes:**
- Click the toggle button on the upper right corner to switch to dark mode.
- Click the toggle button on the upper right to switch to light mode.

4. **Automatic Theme Recall:**
The application automatically recalls your chosen theme using local storage, even after you close and reopen it.

## How It Works

The application uses JavaScript to detect the user's theme preference and store it in local storage. It then applies the appropriate styles to the UI elements to create a consistent dark or light mode experience.

The script.js file contains the code responsible for switching themes and managing local storage.
